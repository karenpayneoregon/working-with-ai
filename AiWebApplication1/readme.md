An experiment for Copilot agent to add Serilog to this project. 

- See markdown files under the `Documentation folder`.

  - `Instructions.md` for steps taken
  - `Serilog.md` is an export of the Copilot thread

  ## Logging 

  - Out of the box ASP.NET Core 7.0 uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` for logging.
  - There are many logging providers available for ASP.NET Core, including Serilog, NLog, and log4net. 
      - Each provider has benefits over the stock logger
  
This project logging was setup using Copilot agent which worked on several files at once.
