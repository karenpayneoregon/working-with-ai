This code sample is for seeing if `Copilot` can set up a `int to enum conversion`. As mentioned below there were failures for adding a connection string to appsettings.json and modifying a property type. 


My thought is Copilot did a decent job for an experienced developer while for a novice developer they might struggle with not understanding missing changing Manufacturer property in Automobiles model.


See [Instructions.md](Instructions.md) for the prompts used to generate the code.
