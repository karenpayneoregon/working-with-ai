Gave ChatGPT Program.cs and ContextOptions.cs, asked it to refactor Program.cs to use ContextOptions.

To properly utilize your `ContextOptions` helper and avoid illegal operations on EF Core's internal options, the best approach is to **inject the preconfigured `DbContextOptions<Context>`**. Here's a clear path forward:

---

### ✅ Correct Refactoring Steps

1. **Use `ContextOptions.DbContextOptionsBuilderProduction`** to prebuild the options.
2. **Register the prebuilt options** as a singleton in the DI container:

   ```csharp
   var preconfigured = ContextOptions.DbContextOptionsBuilderProduction(connectionString).Options;
   builder.Services.AddSingleton(preconfigured);
   ```
3. **Register your `DbContext` using that prebuilt options object**:

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddDbContextPool<Context>();
   ```

EF Core will automatically use the registered `DbContextOptions<Context>` when it's found in the DI container.

---

### 🧱 Why This Works

* `AddDbContextPool<TContext>()` without a lambda will pull the already-registered `DbContextOptions<TContext>`.
* This avoids mutating the builder's `Options` collection.
* It leverages your abstraction (`ContextOptions`) cleanly and traditionally.

---

Let me know if you also need support for toggling between production and development configurations dynamically using the environment — that would involve conditionally calling `DbContextOptionsBuilderDevelopment` instead.
